# Image Captioning API

This is an image captioning API built with Flask, allowing users to upload images and generate captions using various deep learning models.

## Features

- Supports multiple deep learning models for image captioning, including MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, ResNet50, Transformer and BLIP.
- Users can upload images through a simple web interface.
- Provides real-time captioning with processing time displayed.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning-api.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd image-captioning-api
```
3. Install the required Python packages:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
